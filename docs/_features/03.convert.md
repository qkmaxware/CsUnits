Many conversions between units are already implemented as extension methods. Default conversions only work on types that implement the [IConvertible](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iconvertible) interface and always returns values of type `double`.  
```cs
var grams = 12.g();
var kg = grams.ToKiloGrams();

Console.WriteLine(kg); // Prints "0.012kg"
```
