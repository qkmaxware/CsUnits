Create instances of measured quantities in whatever way you are most comfortable with. You can use standard c# constructors or by using extension methods. Some extension methods even mirror the symbol of the unit allowing for clean, readable, and unobtrusive instantiation of measured quantities.
```cs
var a = new Quantity<double, Gram>(12); // Instantiate with constructor
var b = 12.As<Gram, double>();          // Instantiate with generic extension method
var c = 12.g();                         // Instantiate with symbol of unit extension method
```
