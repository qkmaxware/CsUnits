Create instances of measured quantities using standard c# constructors or by using extension methods on any other type of object. Each of the following examples will all create the same kind of object. 
```cs
var a = new Quantity<double Gram>(12);  // Instantiate with constructor
var b = 12.As<Gram, double>();          // Instantiate with generic extension method
var c = 12.g();                         // Instantiate with symbol of unit extension method
```
