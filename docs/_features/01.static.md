C# units is designed for static "compile-time" checking for units. This does limit what can be done with units such as losing the ability to generate derived units from mathematical expressions automatically.However, this trade-off allows for unit mis-use to be identified and prevented at compile time rather than waiting for exceptions to be thrown at runtime. 
```cs
// F{N} = M{kg} * A{m/s^2}
public Quantity<double, Newton> Force(Quantity<double, KiloGram> mass, Quantity<double, MetrePerSecondSq> accel) {
    return (mass.Value * accel.Value).N();
}
```
