It is easy to create new units of measurement simply by extending the `Qkmaxware.Units.IUnit` interface. This interface requires that we implement two static properties Name and Symbol. It's as easy as that to create new units.
```cs
public struct MyCustomUnit : IUnit {
    public static string Name => "My Custom Unit";
    public static string Symbol => "mcu";
}
```
