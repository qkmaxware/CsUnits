Nautilus has released a minor 1.0.1 to the package registry [here](https://github.com/qkmaxware/NautilusUnits/packages). This version makes some changes to the underlying hierarchy for quantities. There are now 2 types of quantity `Quantity<Unit>` as a shorter and simplified interface for quantities of type `double` and `Quantity<Type, Unit>` for generalized quantities that can store any type. Both of these type extend the new `BaseQuantity` type which is now used as the basis for all conversions and extension methods. Additionally the two quantity types are implicitly able be to converted between the two allowing for them both to be used seamlessly together. 

Other notable changes:
1. Added units for angular velocity including Radians/Second and Degrees/Second
